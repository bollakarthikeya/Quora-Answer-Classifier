The classifier implemented uses Support Vector Machines (Linear Kernel).

Pre-processing:
===============
1. Looking at the features, there are 23 features in total (ignoring the answer_id and answer_quality which are the first two attributes).
2. Features 3, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 are binary valued. Hence they have been removed as part of pre-processing
3. Features 22 and 23 are zero valued. They have also been removed as they wouldn't contribute to classification
4. Data has been standardized (z-score transformation)

Classification:
================
For training the model, 10-fold cross-validation has been used.
